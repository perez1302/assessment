     My name is Perez Govender. I was born on the 2nd of April 1999.
     I am from a small town called Tongaat in the KZN area. Growing up I did 
     not have much but I made do with I was given. At the age of 9 my parents purchased our first home pc, I won't
     forget the crazy my brother and through after putting it on as it was something new, but at that moment I knew my love for 
     computers have begun. In high my grade 9 year is one I would not forget, it was the year were all grade 9's had to choose 
     they course they would like to study through the next 3 years of high school. Being an I.T. lover my first choice was I.T. but 
     a lot of doubt and underestimation was installed, reason being that I.T. is difficult and I wouldn't make it, that did not stop me,
     I pushed back and proved everybody wroong, I became one of the top achievers in I.T. during my schooling time. At this point I then expanded 
     my love for I.T. into the software aspect of it, at that moment I knew I had to become a software developer. 4 years later on the 30th of July 2021 I graduated from Durban 
     University of Technology with a National Diploma in Information and Communication Technology in Application Development, it was the proudest moment 
     in my life, it was the day I not only proved people wrong but the day I got to show those who thought they couldn't do it, that they can.
     Due to funding not being easy to come around I had to pause my qualification at a Diploma, once I take off with a job in my career field I plan on 
     achieving a further qualification which is a degree  just to know that I completed my goal fully.
     Don't let the study background bore you, I do have other features as well, for starters I enjoy the outdoors going out for hikes, adventuring new places,
     camping, and much more. Hobbies are something that I have too many of which is not a very good thing as to fund those hobbies are not easy,
     but a few just to understand me better include fishing being at the absolute top of the list, Playing soccer coming right below that, Swimming, playing one of the
     traditional South African sports being cricket, and the list goes on. I am a very curious minded individual who is always wanting to know how does something work, I will 
     make it my mission to figure and understand it out. I'm an ambitious and hardworking individual who always make show I get my work completed on or before time.
     I don't want to spoil to much about myself here because with the hopes of getting selected for this program I would like to keep a few details for my live interview.
     That's me in a jiffy or essay rather.

         <h2> Why I want to be a Developer at SovTech? </h2>
 <p>
    This was a question that did not take me too long to figure an answer for. Once reading SovTech spex it made me realise the values that SovTech carry, these are values 
    that kept me going through everything, these are values that I carry myself, and it made me see SovTech as my best option to give my career a chance with. Growing 
    up I had a lot of dreams, dreams to be someone successful, someone who can give they kids a better life then they had, someone that can make a difference, and after 
    falling inlove with coding to become one of the best out there. Being the determained person I believe to be I never let one of it go, I made it my 
    lifes duty to accomplish all those dreams and goals I set out. Once I was done doing my research about SovTech I realised that there would be no other company than
    SovTech that will help me start my career of and take it to where I need it to be. I think SovTech would suit me ideal as I feel I would get the best
    exposure and learning experience that I will need as a fresh graduate and this is the reason I choose SovTech, Because SovTech can take me to places where I 
    want to be in my career.
    If I am to be considered for this role, I promise to give nothing but my best to SovTech. I promise to be the hardworking individual that SovTech needs and 
    continously give SovTech the results that's needed. It would be a great honour to be considered further for this post.
    Thank You.
